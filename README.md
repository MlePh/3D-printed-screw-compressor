Attempt to use a 3D printed screw compressor as ventilator to fight Covid-19.

I was thinking about a ventilator that is controlled by the patients themselve. So good, high
grade ventilators can be used for the critical cases, while mild ones use this one. Or maybe
even use it at home?!?

But thats just me thinking. I have no medical background and absolutely no experience
in medical ventilation. I am just an engineer trying a different approach to a problem.

My design is open source. If you see potential, use it and adapt it to your needs.

my conclusions as of 02.04.2020:

Not enough pressure. Maybe it's because the tolerances with a 3D printer are not good enough,
or there is something wrong with the design (air intakes, screw profile,...).

pros:

- easy to build and reproduce
- compact design
- easy to control (just adjust time and speed)
- cheap
- parts needed should be easy to get

cons:

- not enough pressure
- loud (at least on higher rpms)
- 3D printing takes a lot of time
